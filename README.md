# Sensing Data Benchmarking to Infer Individual Traits

Ubiquitous devices, such as smartphones and wearables, are becoming increasingly popular for monitoring user behavior, health, and well-being. Through omnipresent monitoring, they aim to raise user awareness and encourage positive health behavior change. Yet, ubiquitous technologies suffer from expectation mismatch, lack of user-centric contextualization, and, ultimately, high abandonment rates. This work is motivated by the strong need to tailor and personalize ubiquitous technologies while dealing with the challenges arising from the absence of relevant, self-reported user data. To this end, we show that passively collected sensing data can be exploited to improve personalization and infer several user states relevant to demographic, physiological, psychological, and personality aspects, complementing the need for costly self-reports. To accomplish this task and enable the reproducibility and extensibility of our work, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite by exploiting data derived from the publicly available, newly released LifeSnaps dataset. Our benchmark covers a wide range of personalization tasks, including modeling gender, age, personality traits, and stress, reaching AUC-ROC scores of 0.9. The applicability of the presented work has strong potential in critical applications such as mental healthcare monitoring, privacy preservation, and responsible artificial intelligence by fostering fairness assessments when protected attribute knowledge is unavailable.

This is a repository for sharing our comprehensive benchmark suite containing all the potential inferences that can be done exploiting the publicly available [LifeSnaps Dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01764-x). The preprocessing and dataframe creation notebooks create the unified dataframes used in the whole pipeline. The feature engineering notebooks add the new domain-specific features. The ml models notebooks consist of all the state-of-the-art machine learning models inferring various user traits. Finally, the visualizations notebooks include the exploratory data analysis and all the features presented in the paper submitted for review.

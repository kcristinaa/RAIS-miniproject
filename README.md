# Quantified Self Uncovered: Sensing Data Benchmarking to Infer Individual Traits

Ubiquitous devices, such as smartphones and wearables, are becoming increasingly popular for monitoring user behavior, health,
and well-being. Through omnipresent monitoring, they aim to raise user awareness, inspired by the “Quantified Self” movement,
and encourage positive health behavior change. Yet, ubiquitous technologies suffer from expectation mismatch, lack of user-centric
contextualization, and, ultimately, high abandonment rates. This work is motivated by the strong need to tailor and personalize
ubiquitous technologies while dealing with the challenges arising from the absence of relevant, self-reported user data. To this end,
we show that passively collected sensing data can be exploited to improve personalization and infer several user traits relevant to
demographic, physiological, psychological, and personality aspects, eliminating the need for costly self-reports. To accomplish this
task and enable the reproducibility and extensibility of our work, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite by exploiting data
derived from the publicly available, newly released LifeSnaps dataset. Our benchmark covers a wide range of personalization tasks,
including modeling gender, age, personality traits, and stress, reaching AUC-ROC scores of 0.9. The applicability of the presented
work has strong potential in critical applications such as mental healthcare monitoring, privacy preservation, and responsible artificial
intelligence by fostering fairness assessments when protected attribute knowledge is unavailable.
